Our project is to create a Student Management System where an administrative person can see a 
student's name, DOB, and tuition. They could also see teachers' names, the subject they teach, and their 
yearly salary. The Administrative person can search for a specific student/teacher by using their name. 
They can also add, delete, and edit students/teachers' profiles as they see fit. The class Admin_Directory
is an array list that stores the students/teachers. The Student/Teacher class would contain strings, 
The full_data base class would help users search for a specific person from the two classes. A user could 
experience a possible scenario if a student calls an administrator and asks how much their tuition is for 
the year. The administrator needs to get their name and type it into the program, and it would then 
prompt up the student's information. Another scenario that could happen is that if a teacher believes 
they deserve a raise, the teacher can negotiate with the administrator. The administrator can then go 
into the teacher's profile and raise their yearly salary. Lastly, the administrator could delete the student 
from the roster if a student decides to unenroll from the school. These scenarios are a few out of many 
possible situations that could arise. Our project aims to make it easier to display, store, and edit 
students/teachersâ€™ information.
